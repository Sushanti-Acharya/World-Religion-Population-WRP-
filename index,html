<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>Visualization is an interactive process of data presentation. It allows the user to analyse the data in picturized format. Visualization is often used to display the story that the data witholds. Similarly, for our project we have created interactive visualisations for world demographics based on religion.</p>

<h2>Dataset Selection:</h2>

<p>For the presentaion of the interactive visualizations, we have selected the <b>World Religion Population&nbsp;dataset</b> which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/world-religion-data">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Understanding the diversity of the population based on their religion across the globe.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>This dataset contains details about the segmentation of the world population based on the religion.</p>

<h1>Why is this dataset ?</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Of all the 195 countries in the world, there are roughly around 4200 religions adhered by different populations.</li>
	<li>Many countries are known based on the religion followed by them. Understanding the diversity and analysing which country has the most dominant religion is what this dataset helps in.</li>
	<li>The data of different religions across the globe is available in three sections,i.e, National, Regional and Global. It contains the data of various different religions and their sub categories that were recorded from the year 1945-2010</li>
	<li>This dataset was used to develop informative visualizations and analysing which Country and/Continent is more diverse or which relation do most of the population in the world follow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications Used:</h2>

<p>For this assignment we have used python programing. For better visualisations we have also used libraries such as; bokeh, matplot, plotly, altair. </p>

<h2>Data Visualisation:</h2>

<h3>Islamic Religion Adherents</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Sushanti-Acharya/World-Religion/blob/master/Islam%20Religion%20Region%20Wise.html"><img alt="" src="Islam religion.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>This graph projects the distribution of population who adhere to Islam Religion. We can see the distribution from the year 1945 to 2010.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph, We can see that Middle East has the max population adhering to Islamic Religion. Whereas, it can be observed that at present West.Hemisphere has the most population of Islamic Adherents.</p>

<div>Features for this graph are:</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> Box </span>Zoom&nbsp;(can be zoomed to see the details in years)</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Auto Scaling</div>

<h3>Comparing Different Religions Based on Their Population in Different Region </h3>

<p>The 2nd visualisation is an interactive&nbsp;scatter plot showing Hindu, Islamic, Christian and Budhhist population over the period of years based on the regions they are obsereved in. Click on the above image to view the interactive visualisation.</p>

<h3>Population of All Religions Across the Globe from 1945-2010</h3>

<p>In this visualisation, we can see the population of every religion recorded.</p>
<p>On selecting different features, this graph helps us to focus on specific religions or year</p>

<div>Features for this graph are:</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> Box </span>Zoom&nbsp;(can be zoomed to see the details per date and time of the day and&nbsp;across the years)</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> Wheel </span>Zoom</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Taking a screenshot of graph.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>We have also provided save and reset option to help the users save and restore the graph as required.</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Additionally an option to learn more about bokeh plot.</div>

<h1>Contribution of Team members:</h1>

<p>The project being a group assignment, every individual invested long hours in designing and developng of visualisations. Understanding the process, deciding the dataset, finalizing the designing language were some of the initial tasks completed as a team.</p>

<p>Data preperation and visualization were equally distributed among all three. The whole process including the webpage creation took us around 80 hours, which involved the meetings, discussions and research on coding practice and learning different tools and libraries.</p>

<p>During the process of developing this project, we learned visualization, but along with it we also experienced working as a team, dealing with agreements, disagreements, challenges, etc which helped in ou overall development.</p>
